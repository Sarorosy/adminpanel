13. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.
Except for disputes brought in small claims court, all disputes between you and greenmart arising out of, relating to or in connection with the Site or Services shall be exclusively settled through binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for commercial arbitration and not in court. This agreement to arbitrate applies to any claim brought under the laws of any state or national government, including claims under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, or any other federal, state or local law or ordinance. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and you are agreeing to waive your right to pursue claims in court to the greatest extent permitted by law. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court and review by a court is limited. YOU AND greenmart AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the class and representative-action waiver in the prior sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable, however, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration, and any class or representative-action claims shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington. This arbitration agreement is entered into and enforceable pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if greenmart makes any future change to this dispute resolution provision, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) about which you had already provided notice to greenmart. Information on AAA and how to start arbitration can be found at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. If the arbitration in this Section provision is found unenforceable or to not apply for a given dispute, then the proceeding must be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington. You hereby accept the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for this purpose. To the extent enforceability of this Agreement requires reference to any state law, the Parties agree such reference shall be to the laws of the State of Washington without regard to conflict of law provisions.
13.1 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Prior to resorting to formal dispute resolution procedures, you hereby agree to try to resolve disputes amicably and efficiently by emailing customer support at support@greenmart.com. Any communication to us regarding any dispute you have must be sent within ninety calendar days of the date of the event giving rise to the dispute. You agree that engaging in this pre-arbitration dispute resolution procedure is a prerequisite to initiating a complaint in arbitration or any other form. If pre-arbitration dispute resolution efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) within ninety calendar days of the date on which the parties agree that the pre-arbitration dispute resolution has failed. The Notice to us should be sent to the address identified in Section 14.6 below. You hereby agree that failure to follow any of the steps outlined in this paragraph operates as a waiver of your right to pursue your claims in arbitration or any other forum.
13.2 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
13.3 Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided in Section below. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will individually arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
